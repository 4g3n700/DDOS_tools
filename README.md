# DDOS_tools
This repository contain my personal collection of DDOS tools. I obtained the source code of the programs on the internet and I do not claim to be the author or collabolator of the said tools. I have only taken my time to put them together and fix known bugs and improve the quality of the code.

These tools shall be used at your personal discretion and any harm caused intentionally and/or accidentally shall thereby not be my fault. Enjoy hunting!
